Create Logger 

1. Normally what the web server working 

Controller -> Service -> Repository 

2. In order to create logger it need to have another layer 
and this layer is working first 

Filter -> Controller -> Service -> Repository

- And this Filter we can us as Interceptor (កាក់យកពាក់កណ្តាលគេ)​
- ពេលយើងចាប់របស់នឹងហើយយើងអាចកែវាបានហើយ 
- Filter it have many purpose it can be : Security , Logger , Interceptor then forward to another 
Example:

We have three kind of customer : in the web service it have three kinds of Token 

1. Token one for normal customer 
2. Token two for Primuam 
3. Token three for pro 

So according to their token we can for ward there user to Normal, Primum or Pro 


--------------------------------------------------------

Filter is the Interface 

* public class ReactiveLoggingFilter implements WebFilter

in java also have filter and spring also have Filter it called : WebFilter 

- Filter we can have many filter as we want 
Example : 

- Logging Filter 
- Authentication Filter 

And we also can config which filter need to be working first 

In the Method it need to forward to another chain 

+ WebFilterChain chain That why we need to have it "return chain.filter(exchange);"


=================================================================================================

Gold : Method / Path  

==> GET /api/rooms
<== GET /api/rooms - 200 (81 ms)

So first from the 

public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, WebFilterChain chain)

តាមរយៈ ServerWebExchange exchange​ from exchange we can get request and responde
